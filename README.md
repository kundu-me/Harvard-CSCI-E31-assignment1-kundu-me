# Assignment 1: Getting your environment set up

This assignment is to ensure that you've got your environment set up correctly for this course. There's no requirement for creating any of your own code - the required code is all included in our instructions for how to set up git, github, Digital Ocean, and the connections between them.

The description of this assignment can be found [in Canvas at Assignment #1](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/96093/assignments/551415) (Spring 2022)

You should build your application in this repo cloned for you in Github Classroom. You'll submit your Digital Ocean URL and github URL in Canvas.
